            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>DID not the Tyranny of Cuſtom com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell it, nor the daily Examples of thoſe that put out any thing in Print, encourage it; yet would the ſmall thing to which this is promiſed, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily require ſome Reaſons to be rendred, for the publication of it.</p>
                  <p>I can ſafely ſay, it was not Ambition to be ſeen in Print, that put me upon it; I have often blamed others, for their forwardneſs in that kind, and have obſerved, that ſome who would not be adviſed, but have perſiſted in the Vanity of putting out their Works (as they call them) have got little or nothing by it, not ſo much as the applauſe they aimed at, much leſs the Gain they propoſed to themſelves. And as very few have advantaged themſelves, ſo have ſome as little benefitted others, or ſo much as ſatisfyed the expectation of their Readers.</p>
                  <p>I have therefore hitherto, contented my ſelf (as many greater, and more Learned Men then
<pb facs="tcp:33427:3"/>I have done) with a fair and cleanly Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on without Book, and ſhould still have ſo done, had not the great, and not to be deny'd impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of Friends (both Patients and Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians) preſs me ſo long, and ſo much that I could no longer withſtand their Sollicitations.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, it hath been very often propos'd, and deſir'd (and by many wondred at, that it was not done, if for no other end, then for the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the City) that a Catalogue of Eminent Cures ſhould every Year be Printed, which though it hath been by ſome attempted, yet is the thing hardly Practicable (if poſſible to be done) for theſe following Reaſons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Very few will be contented (eſpecially in ſome Caſes) to have their Names menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned (ſo publickly at leaſt, as is putting them into a Printed Paper) leaſt it ſpoyl their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, or make them a common talk. And to put out a Rehearſal of Cures, without na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the Perſons on whom they were wrought, (that enquiry might be made of the truth of it) might be looked upon as a Deceit, nor much better then a <hi>Quack</hi>'s Setting up a Bill, at the corner of a Street, and one without a Name might probably call in queſtion the truth of all the reſt.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:33427:3"/>
                  <p>A Second Reaſon is, where one finds preſent Advantage, whilſt he is here <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t at leaſt a perfect Recovery, or ſuch as will be ſure to hold, which time only can try) there be many that go away little alter'd from what they were when they came hither, and yet afterwards recover by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, of which not one in Forty gives an account, nor do we hear of them again, unleſs it be by chance.</p>
                  <p>And then thirdly, ſome are ſo horridly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, that they induſtriouſly conceal (what they can) the Benefit they receive, for fear of being more obliged to gratifie thoſe that have taken care of them, of which great ingratitude many inſtances might be given, were it to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> (and what is indeed of as much Concern as all the Reſt) They that need much, and long Bathing, eſpecially if they come in the hotteſt Seaſon of the Year, (which is not always their own, but ſometimes their Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians fault, that will not part with them whilſt they can take Phyſick, or give Fees,) are ſo enfeebled with long and much Bathing and Sweating, that till they have Recovered that Fatiegue, they cannot be ſenſible, what-Benefit they have received, which ſome do ſooner, and ſome later, but ſcarce return back any account hom they ſpeed.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:33427:4"/>
                  <p>And here may juſtly be reprehended thoſe that, either upon their own <hi>Heads,</hi> or by the advice of the <hi>Bath-Guides,</hi> or out of lucre to have as much for their Money as they can, (though to their hurt) ſtay too long at a time, or go in twice a day, or more frequently then will well conſiſt <hi>with their Strength,</hi> or preſent Circumſtances. If a <hi>Phyſician</hi> adviſe againſt it, he ſhall be cenſured, as if he did it for his own end, to ke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>By theſe means, ſome have gone away, to all <hi>Appearance,</hi> as <hi>Bad</hi> or <hi>Worſe,</hi> then they came, and yet (after reſting at home a while) attain by <hi>Degrees,</hi> the end they came for.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifth,</hi> There is another impatient ſort of People, that if they are not preſently well, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo many times <hi>Bathing</hi> or Drinking (the number of which they propoſe to themſelves, or others for <hi>them</hi>) enter preſently upon ſome new <hi>Courſe,</hi> or take ſome trivial Medicine, which comes under the ſpecious <hi>Character</hi>

                     </gap>n approved <hi>Receipt,</hi> though perhaps may ſignifie no more then <hi>Chips in Pottage,</hi> and then imputs the Advantage they receive, to what they took laſt, though <hi>the Bath</hi> or <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> had wrought it before, and they would not allow time to expect the Succeſs. Which thing hath made me very often give this <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi> not to enter upon the uſe of any other
<pb facs="tcp:33427:4"/>
                     <hi>Remedy</hi> (unleſs great Neceſſity compel) till after a Month or ſix Weeks time.</p>
                  <p>I do the rather mention this, becauſe I find a Phyſician of great Name in his time, bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the <hi>Bath</hi> (in ſome of his <hi>Obſervations</hi>) without Cauſe, and indeed, not without juſt Suſpition of ſome Self-endedneſs; I am ſure, without allowing ſufficient time to try, <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Bath were Blameable or no,</hi> or did not rather deſerve the <hi>Reputation</hi> of that <hi>Recovery,</hi> which was afterwards (too parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally perhaps) aſcribed to his own Method.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are ſome of the Reaſons, why a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue <hi>hitherto,</hi> hath not been made publick. Now if (inſtead of that) there be a Manual fitted to every ones Price and Pocket (which is one, and a chief deſign of this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking) that ſhall give ſome instances upon every conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Head, what Cures have been here done for more then Fourty years paſt, and the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons named (where it is convenient ſo to do) that either, from themſelves (if living till this time) or their ſurviving Friends, and Relations, (if ſince Dead) the truth of what is here rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) may be enquired into; <hi>I</hi> think it may at once, attain all thoſe ends, that a yearly Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, could any may pretend unto.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:33427:5"/>
                  <p>And in doing this, I ſhall only relate <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact,</hi> not medling much with <hi>Theories,</hi> or ſetting up new <hi>Hypotheſes.</hi> He that does that, does (as it were ſet up a <hi>Shrove Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day Cock,</hi> for every one to throw at, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſo much as paying <hi>Two Pence for Three Throws.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Age we live in, is a <hi>Learned and rathe Ripe Age,</hi> and many think they know more, and ſooner then thoſe that lived before them, and indeed they are, and do ſo, if they are not miſtaken. I am ſure if they do, they have had more Advantages for it, then many of their Predeceſſors. Therefore I ſolemnly declare, that I mainly deſign this, not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct Phyſicians, but to direct <hi>Patients,</hi> where and how to ſeek for <hi>Remedy,</hi> by the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of thoſe that have here found it, in the ſame or like Caſes with theirs. And I ſhall not (in the leaſt] Foreſtal, or prejudice the diligent endeavours of well deſigned Men of our <hi>Faculty,</hi> baving not given the Copy of any one <hi>Preſcription,</hi> uſed in any Caſe, in this my long Practice here, but have only hinted (in the general) what courſe I uſually took in the ſeveral Diſeaſes therein mentioned, and what the ſucceſs was, whether <hi>Good or Bad,</hi> and have declared one, as well as the other; that as one may ſupply the place of a <hi>Land Mark,</hi> the other may do the Office of a <hi>Buoy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:33427:5"/>
                  <p>I do alſo ſolemnly averr, that I will not (as others have done) ſet down any Recovery, barely upon Report, or what hath been done by others, but only ſuch as <hi>I</hi> my Self have been alone concerned in; or joyned with another <hi>Phyſician, or Phyſicians,</hi> or by and with the Communicated <hi>Advice</hi> of <hi>Him</hi> or <hi>Them,</hi> that Recommended the <hi>Patient</hi> to my Care, whoſe <hi>Names</hi> alſo <hi>I</hi> have in ſome, if not moſt Inſtances inſerted.</p>
                  <p>Now though <hi>I</hi> have declared againſt <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> and <hi>Hopotheſis,</hi> yet I may (<hi>I</hi> think) without Breach of that <hi>Promiſe,</hi> ſay ſomething in <hi>Anſwer</hi> to a Queſtion that hath been ſome Hundred of times asked me, ſince <hi>I</hi> came to live upon this <hi>Place,</hi> viz. <hi>What is the Reaſon of the Heat of the Bath-Waters?

                  <p>
                     <hi>As I was with ſome of my Companions,</hi>

                     <hi>wandring in</hi> Savoy, <hi>I found in the Valley of</hi> Luzerne (<hi>betwixt the</hi> Alpes) <hi>a hot Spring, I began to conſider the cauſe of this Heat, and whereas the vulgar opinion is, that the heat of Fountains, is from Mountains fired within, I ſaw Reaſon to think the contrary, becauſe I ſaw Snow unmelted upon a Mountain, from whence this Hot Spring came, which could not poſſibly but have been diſſolved, by the hot Fumes of the Mountain, had it been fired within. Whereupon being unſatisfied, I with my Companions, and other Labourers (whom I could very hardly perſwade to undertake ſuch a Buſineſs, by reaſon they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, that Fire would thereupon break forth out of the Ground and conſume us) got Tools, and ſet upon digging, to find out the true cauſe of the heat of this Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>After we had digged Fifteen Days, [having perceived before, the Water to be hotter and hotter by Degrees, as we came nearer to the ſource) we came to the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of the Heat, where was a great E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bullition. In three hours more, we dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged beyond this place of Ebullition, and
<pb facs="tcp:33427:7"/>perceived the Water to be cold, yet in the ſame continued ſtream with the other that was hot. Upon this, I began to wonder much at the reaſon of theſe things. Then I carryed to my Lodg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ng ſome of this hot Water, (which was both Saltiſh and Acid) and evaporated it, and of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Ounces, I had in the bottom five Drachms of Saltiſh Matter, which I then farther purefy'd, and extracted thence three Drachms of pure Nitrous, Herme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, Salt, the other two Drachms, being a ſlymy Sulphurous Subſtance. Yet with this I was not ſatisfyed, but with my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers, went again to the Place, and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged twelve Days more, and then we came to a Water which was inſipid, as ordinary Fountain Water, yet ſtill in a continued Stream, with the Saltiſh Hot Water.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>At this I wondred much, whereupon I digging up ſome of the Earth, where the cold and Saltiſh Stream runned, and carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it home with me, and out of a Hundred weight thereof, I extracted a good quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Nitrous Salt, which was almoſt Fluxile. When I had extracted as much as I could, I lay'd the Earth aſide, and in twenty four Hours, it was all covered o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with Salt, which I extracted, and out of a hundred weight of this Earth (which
<pb facs="tcp:33427:7"/>I call</hi> Virgin-Earth) <hi>I had four Pound of this kind of Salt, which it contracted in the aforeſaid Twenty Four Hours, and ſo it would do conſtantly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Now this ſatisfyed me concerning one Doubt (for before I was unſatisfyed) how there could be a conſtant ſupply of that Salt, which made the Water Saltiſh, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there was but a little diſtance betwixt the inſipid Water, and the Hot Water, and the conſtant ſtream of Water waſhed away the Salt that was in that little ſpace. For I perceived that this kind of Earth, attracts this Univerſal Salt of the World, partly from the Fire, in the Cavities of the Earth, and partly from the Vapours, that paſs conſtantly through the Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>After this, I took ſome of that Earth, where the Ebullition was, and carryed it home, and proved it, and I perceived it to be a Sulphur Mine, into which the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Acid Saltiſh Water penetrating, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed an Ebullition (as do Salt of Tartar, and Spirit of Vitriol mixed together, and alſo Water poured on unſlackt Lyme.) Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, I began to queſtion how it was, that this Sulphur-Mine was not conſumed, ſeeing ſo much Water paſſeth from it daily, but I began to underſtand how all things in the Earth did aſſimulate to themſelves,
<pb facs="tcp:33427:8"/>whatſoever was of any kind of Affinity to them (as Mines convert the Tools of Miners into their own Subſtance, in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time, and ſuch like Experiments of that Nature) I was ſatisfyed. And after all this, I underſtood how this</hi> Univerſal Salt of the World <hi>was to be had, and I could at any time mix it with Water, and pour that Water upon Sulphur, and ſo make an Artificial</hi> Hot Bath, <hi>as good as any Natural Bath whatſoever. Since this, reading Monſieur</hi> Blondel of the <hi>Baths</hi> at <hi>Aix-la-Chapelle,</hi> I find that <hi>Henricus Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas Medicus,</hi> had written a Treatiſe <hi>de A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis Mineralibus,</hi> whence (I ſuppoſe) Dr. <hi>French</hi> had this Story; Dr. <hi>Rochas's</hi> Book I never ſaw, if I had, I ſhould rather have quoted him then Dr. <hi>French.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It ſeems Monſieur <hi>Rochas,</hi> was a <hi>Virtuoſo,</hi> and <hi>Chymically</hi> enclined, and if the Relation be to be depended upon, it ſeems leſs lyable to difficulties, then the other <hi>Hypotheſis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Something like this, probably it muſt be to continue warmth to the Waters of the <hi>Bath</hi> ſo long, without interruption, or conſiderable Alteration. And why not then.</p>
                  <p>Two <hi>Channels</hi> in the <hi>Bowels</hi> of the Earth differently impregnated with the <hi>Streams, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors</hi> or <hi>Subſtances</hi> (it matters not much which) of different Salts, or Mineral Juices,
<pb facs="tcp:33427:8"/>continuing a while their ſingle courſe, and at length meeting together in a common Channel, as we ſee the Veins in a <hi>Man's Body</hi> do, in the return of the <hi>Blood</hi> to the <hi>Heart,</hi> for as it is in the <hi>Microcoſme,</hi> ſo may it be in the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <p>That ſeveral Liquors are known (and more perhaps upon Trayal may be found) that being cold whilſt aſunder,<note place="margin">Vid. M. Blondels <hi>Thermiae Aquis Gra.</hi>
                     </note> become hot when mixed together ſome of our ſhop Preparations do teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie (as in making <hi>Tartar Vitriolate,</hi> and <hi>Butter of Antimony,</hi> &amp;c.) And if I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber well, Mr. <hi>Boyl,</hi> in one of his <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick Treatiſes</hi> makes mention of <hi>Two Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid Liquors</hi> of his own Preparation, with which be uſed to divert himſelf, and thoſe that came to viſit him, which being apart in ſeveral Glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſeemed (to a tender Finger) rather colden then ordinary Water, but being put together in one Glaſs, became preſently ſo hot, as to heat the Glaſs ſoconſider ably, as to affright one of the
<pb facs="tcp:33427:9"/>timerous Sex ſo, as to hazard the breaking of it.</p>
                  <p>Now it may eaſily be Granted, that Art being but the <hi>Ape of Nature,</hi> there is nothing in the former, but what was firſt in the latter, and that the great <hi>Chymiſtry,</hi> governed by the greateſt Artiſt in the vaſt <hi>Laboratory</hi> of the <hi>Earth,</hi> comes not ſhort of our ſmall <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes</hi> here, even amongſt the moſt <hi>Adepti.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That which confirmed me in the Opinion, that the actual Heat of theſe Waters, is from this or ſome like Cauſe (for I have already ſufficiently declared againſt <hi>Dogmatizing</hi>) was an Experiment I made, when <hi>William Lord Viſcount Stafford,</hi> (of whom you will find mention made under the Title of <hi>Lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bago,</hi> or <hi>Duplex Sciatica,</hi> Lib. <hi>I.</hi> Obſ. 4th.) continued moſt part of the Winter at the <hi>Bath,</hi> and lived in my <hi>Houſe,</hi> and <hi>Bathed three or four times a Week in the King's-Bath</hi> (when the Weather was calm) from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of November forward.</p>
                  <p>He was in the <hi>Bath on Chriſtmas-Eve,</hi> and took no Cold all that time. He had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the Conveniency of a Gallery in my Houſe, (which was the Reaſon that his <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> choſe thoſe Lodgings) through which he went into the <hi>King's-Bath,</hi> under Covert, without expoſing himſelf to the open Air, till he came into the <hi>Bath,</hi> when <hi>Stormy and
<pb facs="tcp:33427:9"/>Windy Weather</hi> was (for <hi>Winds</hi> are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways more a hinderance <hi>to Bathing,</hi> then <hi>Rain,</hi> nay, then <hi>Froſt</hi> it ſelf.) I got His Lordſhip a <hi>Bathing Tub,</hi> which hela about Two or Three <hi>Hogs-heads,</hi> and placed it in the <hi>Pump-Houſe.</hi> This Tub was pumped full about Five in the Morning, and between Seven and Eight, his Lordſhip came as at other times, to <hi>Bathe</hi> in it, but finding it (by try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his Hand, as his Cuſtom was) too hot, he commanded the Guides that were there to lave it for Half an Hour, with Hand-Pails, as People cool their Pottage with Spoons) when it was cool enough, he entred the Tub, and ſtay'd his Hour, or Hour and Quarter, as at other times.</p>
                  <p>At my Lord's going off, I commanded the Serjant of the <hi>Bath,</hi> to lock up the Doors, and not to let run the Water, till I came at Night, which I did after Nine of the Clock, and found the Water warm, though there was (if I remember well a Froſt that Day, and a large Window open upon the Tub.</p>
                  <p>Now the Experiment is eaſily tryed, <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Water boyled to the greateſt heigth that may be, will keep its Warmth ſo long as Seventeen Hours, or more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> if it will not, it may be concluded, that this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
<pb facs="tcp:33427:10"/>not from any extraneous Heat (as that of Under-Ground Fires) but from ſome <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi> Particles, rather within it ſelf, which till they are wholly evaporated, continue the Water more or leſs Warm. And theſe <hi>Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Particles,</hi> probably, ſtick cloſer to the little Globules, that make up the Conſiſtence of Fluids, then thoſe, communicated by Fire, can poſſibly do.</p>
                  <p>And now although I have already (more then once declared againſt inſiſting on <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> and new <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> yet <hi>I</hi> do again aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, that I aſſert not this farther, then to tell you what beſt ſatisfied me in this Enquiry, and what I uſually anſwered others, that propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Queſtion to me, recommending only the Farther Conſideration of it, to more inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious, and more induſtrious enquirers, and proceed to what <hi>I</hi> mainly propoſed, which is to lay down plainly what I have obſerved of the Waters themſelves, and the effects they have produced, both in the outward, and inward uſe of them, in thoſe <hi>Diſeaſes,</hi> the particulars of which you will afterwards find mentioned in the following Obſervations; which I ſhall ſoon proceed unto, when I have given you ſome ſhort account of the Occaſion of my coming to live in this Place, which thing I ſhould ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily have been convinced to be needleſs, had
<pb facs="tcp:33427:10"/>not I my Self been one (and that perhaps not the moſt inconſiderable) inſtance of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries obtained by the uſe of theſe Waters, it being for my own Healths Sake, that I firſt came hither.</p>
                  <p>For as my own Sicklineſs and Tender Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, was one of the main Motives, that prevailed with me to bend my Study towards <hi>Phyſick,</hi> for I ſuppoſe it might otherwiſe be intended by my <hi>Father,</hi> when he firſt ſent me to the Univerſity, he being himſelf a Clergy-Man, and <hi>Batchelor in Divinity,</hi> but Died in the <hi>49th.</hi> Year of his Age, before I took my firſt Degree in the Arts) ſo my great Illneſs at that time, was the chief Reaſon that brought me to live at <hi>Bath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It may be needful to let you know that after a weakly Child-hood, I had at Ten Years of Age, a <hi>Dropſie,</hi> an <hi>Aſcites,</hi> and <hi>Anaſarcha,</hi> together, of which I was (with difficulty) <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,</hi> by the Advice of Dr. <hi>Ralph Baily</hi> of this City, a <hi>New-College-Man,</hi> whoſe then Wife, was a Relation of my Mothers a <hi>Hungerford.</hi>) At twelve Years old, I had the <hi>Small-Pox,</hi> which did not (as it was hoped it would) much mend my Sickly Conſtitution. At Fourteen (being then at School, at the <hi>College</hi> near <hi>Wincheſter</hi>) I had a Severe
<pb facs="tcp:33427:11"/>
                     <hi>Tertian Ague,</hi> which held me Six or Seven Weeks. Many accidental Illneſſes, between whiles I had, and ſeldom or never free from a <hi>Head-ach,</hi> which ſometimes would be ſo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent, as to enforce me to give of all Buſineſs for a time.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, I had very frequent Defluctions of <hi>Rheumes,</hi> to my <hi>Teeth</hi> and <hi>Jaws,</hi> to the Pallate of my <hi>Mouth,</hi> and <hi>Glandules</hi> of my <hi>Throat,</hi> even to the hazard, ſometimes of a Suffocation.</p>
                  <p>At One and Twenty, breeding the <hi>Meaſles,</hi> I bled ſo exceſſively at the <hi>Noſe,</hi> for two days together, or longer, that ſome deſpair'd of my Life, my Blood was ſo exceeding thin and ſharp, as well as in a great Ferment, upon Breeding that Diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>At this Rate I rubbed on, till Thirty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when living <hi>Weſtward,</hi> near the <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Maſhy Country,</hi> I was ſeized with an <hi>Epidemick Feaver</hi> (a Diſeaſe uſual in thoſe Parts, about the end of Summer) which upon my ventring too ſoon abroad (to viſit a good Friend, as well as a beneficial Patient) determined in a <hi>Quartan Ague</hi> (a common Diſtemper in that Country, and laſting ſeldom leſs then Six Months, ſometime Twelve or Eighteen; nay
<pb facs="tcp:33427:11"/>I have known ſome in thoſe Parts, to have kept it Two or Three Years, and one that had it Seven Years.) It is a ſcandalous thing in that Countrey, for a <hi>Phyſician</hi> to be Sick, much more a Reproach is it, to the whole <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,</hi> for him to die. The Scandal I could not avoid, the Reproach I kept free from, for I was recovered of it in Three Months, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Jeſuit's. Powder</hi> (ſcarce known at leaſt in thoſe parts then or any other fam'd <hi>Febri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge,</hi> only with a plain <hi>Alterative</hi> and <hi>Ape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritive</hi> Courſe (ſedulouſly follow'd, and for five or ſix Weeks continued) in which a Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Steel</hi> and <hi>Aaron Rootes</hi> prepared, had a conſiderable ſhare.</p>
                  <p>In the midst of this Courſe, Nature offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Diſcharge, by Swelling the <hi>Hemoroid Veins, I</hi> cauſed <hi>Leeches</hi> to be applyed, and Bleed plentifully, from which time <hi>I</hi> apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly got Ground of my Adverſary, every day. This <hi>Quartane</hi> (though ſo ſoon removed) and the Preceeding <hi>Feaver,</hi> together with the ill ſteams of that Marſhy Country, left many Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butical Symptomes upon me; for which (reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not to trust a crazy Carkaſs, to that rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Country, another <hi>Autumn</hi>) I removed hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not only becauſe it was near my <hi>Native Air,</hi> (which ſome adviſed, every one yielding me to be in hazard of a Conſumption, even
<pb facs="tcp:33427:12"/>
                     <hi>Phyſicians</hi> as well as Friends) but alſo for the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Baths,</hi> and <hi>Bath Waters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And being now for my Healths Sake ſetled here, I could not reaſonably propoſe to my Self any Advantage of Practice, where there were three well reputed <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> conſtantly reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, beſides ſeveral interlopers, both from <hi>Oxford</hi> and from <hi>London,</hi> and other parts of the Nation, ſome with, others to look for <hi>Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,</hi> (as ſtill there are, and will be, for where the Carcaſs is, there will the <hi>Eagles</hi> be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together.) But it was not Profit that I mainly came for, but Health, which (I deſire Solemnly to Bleſs God for it) I found to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe daily, and therefore determined here to continue, though I had Advice, Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Perſwaſions (particularly from my Friend and Country-Man, and Fellow. Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giate, at <hi>Lincoln-College</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> Dr. <hi>Chriſtopher Bennet</hi>) to remove to <hi>London,</hi> as the likelyeſt place for a Beneficial Practice, but doubting whether a cloſe City [having try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Briſtol,</hi> before I went <hi>Weſtward,</hi> and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that not ſo agreeable) would well conſiſt with my Conſtitution, which always beſt ſuited with an open Air, I ſet up my Staff here.</p>
                  <p>And contenting my Self with that little Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, that fell to my ſmall Share, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning
<pb facs="tcp:33427:12"/>my Self to my Seniors, with that Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference and Reſpect, that did (I thought) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come me, (very different to what ſome ſince have ſhewn to me) I was often deſired by them to go in their ſtead, to Patients in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, when they were hindred by a full <hi>Bath</hi> Practice here, by which means, in proceſs of time, I had the Riding Practice for Ten or Twenty, ſometimes Thirty Miles about, which I ſubmitted to the Trouble of (which is not little, conſidering the very ill ways we have in theſe Parts) till thoſe Elder <hi>Phyſicians</hi> drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping off (and ſome younger Ones too) a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable ſhare of the <hi>Bath Practice</hi> devolved upon me, and here I have continued a conſtant Inhabitant ever ſince, from <hi>the Year, 1653,</hi> to this new begun <hi>Year</hi> of <hi>97,</hi> and to the Age of <hi>75,</hi> without <hi>Gout, Stone, Aſthma, Dropſie,</hi> or any other great <hi>Diſeaſe,</hi> inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to <hi>Old Age,</hi> and not without ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable <hi>Succeſs,</hi> as to the <hi>Health</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery</hi> of others, as well as my Self, and a far greater <hi>Advantage,</hi> then I could reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly have <hi>hoped for.</hi> All which I deſire So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly and Publickly, to aſcribe to the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of the <hi>Great God</hi> only.</p>

                  <p>Now before I conclude this <hi>Prefaratory Diſcourſe,</hi> (though I am very ſenſible that it is already of the longeſt) I thought it requiſit to let you know alſo, that at my firſt coming hither (as ill as I was I was not altogether idle, but having little or no Practice, I had more Leaſure to Read and <hi>Think,</hi> then <hi>I</hi> had in many <hi>Months</hi> I may ſay ſome Years) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And <hi>determining to fix here,</hi> at least for a time) I applyed my Self to thoſe Books that treated of <hi>Baths</hi> and <hi>Mineral Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> and was not backward in making [at leaſt) ordinary Experiments upon theſe; ſuch as Evaporation, mixing various Things with them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I muſt Confeſs, I was not ſo cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, as ſome have ſince been, to how much purpoſe, let the World judge, to ſpend Years about it, nor ſo wiſe as to enquire how many <hi>Hogſheads, Gallons, Quarts</hi> and <hi>Pints,</hi> each <hi>Bath</hi> held. There being no impoſt upon the <hi>Water,</hi> I though it needleſs to employ an Exciſe Man to Gauge the Ponds. It ſufficed me, that there was enough to cover a de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ay'd <hi>Limb,</hi> or a <hi>Leprous Back,</hi> and that there was Water to be had immediately from the <hi>Spring,</hi> without mixing with that, which People <hi>Bathed</hi> in, to Drink.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:33427:13"/>
                  <p>And indeed I was (even then of the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that the uſeful knowledge of a <hi>Mineral Water,</hi> is ſooner and better had a <hi>Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ori,</hi> then a <hi>Priori,</hi> that Experience and long Obſervation, is the beſt and ſureſt way of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring that Knowledge. In which Opinion, I have been ſince much confirmed (and have applauded my Self for thinking ſo formerly) when I found ſo great a Man as Mr. <hi>Boyl</hi> (then whom no Man in this laſt Age, nor in ſome paſt ones, hath been more induſtrious, and no leſs Succeſsful, in trying Experiments, and laying Foundations for new <hi>Theories</hi>) to be of the ſame, and that in a Book, which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned as a Direction to a <hi>Phyſician,</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire effectually into the conſtituent parts of <hi>Mineral Waters,</hi> and to declare himſelf there of the ſame judgment, it is in his <hi>Memoirs,</hi> for the Natural Experimental Hiſtory of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Waters,</hi> addreſſed by way of Letter, to a Friend, its in <hi>8vo. Lond. 1685.</hi> In the Second <hi>Paragraph</hi> of the firſt <hi>Section,</hi> and the <hi>Third Page,</hi> in which Book he hath theſe <hi>Words,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But here I muſt ingeniouſly own to you, that notwithſtanding the many ways I propoſe of diſcovering the Natures, or Qualities of Mineral Waters, yet I think the ſureſt way of knowing them, is a long
<pb facs="tcp:33427:14"/>and ſufficient Experience, of their good and bad Effects. For I ſtrangely ſuſpect (and it may be partly known) that there are beneath the Surface of the Earth, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Mineral Subſtances, ſome Fixed, and ſome Volatile, ſome in the Form of hard Bodies, ſome of ſoft ones, ſome of Liquors and ſome of Fumes, divers of which, the Generality (even of Learned Men) are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together Strangers to, beſides thoſe that (though Men may chance to have ſome) have their Nature ſo little known, that they have not ſo much as Names aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them. So that when I conſider that of the ingredients we are acquainted with to paſs by all the reſt, that the Earth may conceal the proportions wherein they are mingled, may be numberleſs, and the Qualities reſulting from the commixture, may be very differing from thoſe of the ſeperate ingredients, I am apt to look upon the difficulty of Securely determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the effects of Mineral Waters, a <hi>Priori,</hi> as little, if at all leſs then inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable to human Underſtandings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was that great Mans Opinion of this <hi>Thing,</hi> and if a Perſon of his unparalleld Parts, and indefatigable industry and Ability, to be at the <hi>Charge</hi> of <hi>Experiments,</hi> looked
<pb facs="tcp:33427:14"/>upon theſe nicer Enquiries ſo difficult and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, how eaſily may I be exenſed, if I as indeed I did mainly gave my Self to the diligent Obſervation of the eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cts of <hi>theſe Waters,</hi> ſome of which you will find faithfully communicated, under ſeveral Heade of of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, in the following Papers, to which many more Particulars might have been added, had it not been for fear of Swelling the Volume too large a Bulk, it being intended only as a Pocket Companion, for thoſe that need (or would make Tryal of the <hi>Bath and Bath-Waters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If this be received well, and an Enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be thought uſeful, (if it pleaſe God to continue me Life and Health) I ſhall not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think my Pains in doing that alſo. But in this (as it is) you will ſind of thoſe many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, that may be given of great Recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries obtained here, by the uſe of theſe Waters, under my Directions, even when great Means and long Methods of <hi>Phyſick</hi> have failed.</p>
                  <p>If any in the ſame or like Caſes, are encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by this to come hither, and take the ſame courſe which others havr done, and find the ſame Advantage by it, I ſhall think it a ſufficient Compenſation, for all the Trouble and
<pb facs="tcp:33427:15"/>Pains have been a, in looking up my old ſca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Such as it is, accept it, as it is meant and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, <hi>an Advantage to thoſe that need it, and a Direction to the Sick and Lame.</hi> If any one read it out of Curioſity, and think the Deſcriptions of the Diſtempers I give inſtances of, be not acurate enough; let it be remembred, that I have already ſaid, that this is done for the information of <hi>Patients,</hi> and not <hi>Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and for the Satisfaction of the Neceſſities of the former, and not the Nicities of the latter. And I have (for that Reaſon) choſen ſuch Terms as are moſt vulgarly known, and commonly uſed, and where I have been neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to uſe a Term of Art, or a leſs known Expreſſion (which is not often) I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to explain it ſo, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> every ordinary Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, may know what is meant by it.</p>
                  <p>Some perhaps, into whoſe Hands this may come, may wonder that it was not written in a Language, more becoming the Education I have prentended to. Though I have out lived my <hi>Engliſh Teeth,</hi> yet I have not (as old as I am quite forgot my <hi>Latine Tongue,</hi> and had I deſigned it for <hi>Forreigners,</hi> or <hi>Scholars</hi> only, it might have ſpoken that Language. But this was, and is intended, for the Information
<pb facs="tcp:33427:15"/>of thoſe that know no other then what their Mothers taught them. And for the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of that fair Sex, that uſually are skill'd in but one Tongue, and whoſe greateſt Honour it is, to uſe that well.</p>
                  <p>If this plain <hi>Engliſh</hi> may be of Advantage to either, or both, (but eſpecially to the latter) I ſhall not repent me, though others Cenſure it, of the Trouble in Writing, nor will they, I hope, of theirs in Reading it, at leaſt I ſhall ſatisfie my Self in the Preſumption, that both will kindly accept the candid Intentions of</p>

                           <hi>Boneſetters</hi> too; for (by reaſon of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation of the <hi>Ligament</hi> that holds in the Head of the <hi>Thigh-bone,</hi> into the Cup of the <hi>Hip</hi>) that Joynt was diſlocate, and probably had been long before he was put upon this tedious Journey from <hi>Scotland</hi> to the <hi>Bath.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>He had moſt exquiſite Pain, upon the leaſt ſtirring of him, eſpecially when he was lifted into, and out of his Litter, or his Bed. He was a great while upon the way, (three Weeks or a Month) being able to endure but very ſhort Journeys. When he came hither, which was late in the Year, as hath been ſaid, beſides his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from the long continued Pains, and Want of Reſt, and perhaps from frequent taking <hi>Colds</hi> in his Journey (and it may be before) he had a <hi>conſumptive Cough,</hi> and a <hi>Hectical Indiſpoſition;</hi> raiſing a very fowl <hi>Phlegm,</hi> heavy and diſcoloured, inſomuch, that he was in no wiſe fit to be preſently put into the <hi>Bath,</hi> if his other Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces would have permitted it. He was forc'd therefore to reſt a Week or more before we durſt attempt it (which his Uncle that came with him, and his Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and Chaplain, were very haſty, and earneſt for, coming, as they pleaded, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely for it:) And when it was attempted,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:33427:33"/>it was with great difficulty; laying him upon a kind of a Cradle, bottom'd with Girſe-web, letting it down, by degrees, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Bath;</hi> and even thus it was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great Pain to him, and Trouble to his Attendants; and this was done but ſix or ſeven times, before Winter came on ſo far, and his <hi>Pectoral Diſtemper</hi> ſo much increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that we were forc'd to give it over, and apply our ſelves wholly to the <hi>Conſumption,</hi> and <hi>Hectick,</hi> and inconſider the <hi>Sciatica;</hi> for the former threatned his Life, the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter but a Limb; but all that was attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſignified not, for in <hi>February</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he dy'd <hi>Tabid.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Upon the opening of him (for he was Embalmed, wrapped in Cerecloths; thoſe about him knowing no other, but that his Corps was to be carry'd back into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to be interr'd there) it manifeſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd that the decay of his Lungs, was the cauſe of his death. At length order came to bury him here, which was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly done, in the Church of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and a Stone laid upon him; which little Circumſtances I mention, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe what I chiefly deſcribe this Caſe for appear'd fourteen Years after, when the Sexton opening his Grave; to interr another, I happen'd to be walking in the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:33427:34"/>Church, and reprov'd him for uncovering, this Corps ſo ſoon; but he defended hiſmell by ſaying, <hi>That Ground would conſume a Corps in leſs time,</hi> which prov'd very true, for there was not ſo much as a Hands-breadth left together whole of the Cerecloth, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all of the Fleſh. Obſerving the Bones, I took notice, at a diſtance, of a manifeſt difference in their colour; all of them, except thoſe of the lame <hi>Hip</hi> and <hi>Leg,</hi> being as white and as ſmooth, as if prepar'd for a Scelliton, that of the infirm ſide was ſhorter by ſome Inches than the other, and of a dark brown colour, towards a blackiſh, which excited in me a Curioſity to take a more exact notice of them; and looking upon them more narrowly, I found them carious, eaten in, to a conſiderable depth, and thoſe eroſions as cloſe one to another, as they could ſtand by each other, ſo that it look'd like a Honey-Comb, only the erod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Cavities were not ſo regular.</p>

                        <p>The Right Reverend Father in God, the now Biſhop of <hi>Coventry</hi> and <hi>Litchfield,</hi> who (ſome Years paſt, when he was Dr. <hi>Floyde,</hi> and Miniſter of St. <hi>Martin</hi>'s) had ſuch a Pain, and Weakneſs withal, in the <hi>Right Shoulder</hi> and <hi>Arm,</hi> that it became very troubleſome to him, and interrupted his Reſt, and hinder'd his Study, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enabled him to diſcharge the Duties of his place, which he always (till thus hinder'd) was well known to be aſſiduous at. He then came to the <hi>Bath</hi> for it, I think it was in the year 1679. and receiv'd a great deal of Advantage by it, and continued well of it for ten or twelve Years after; but then return'd upon him (when Biſhop of St. <hi>Aſaph</hi>) with greater Violence than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; inſomuch that the conſtant Pain would ſcarcely ſuffer him to take ſufficient
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:33427:40"/>Reſt to ſupport Nature, and that diſorder'd him all over; the whole <hi>Limb</hi> not only uſeleſs but burthenſome to him. His Lordſhip had ſo yielded to that ſide, by reaſon of the Pain and Weakneſs, and weight of that <hi>Arm,</hi> that he ſeem'd to be grown crooked by it, tho' ſtreight before, and is ſince his Recovery. That <hi>Shoulder</hi> was fallen manifeſtly lower than the other, and therefore probably the <hi>Ligament</hi> was relaxed alſo. Upon what accident this Relapſe came, or whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on a ſudden, or by degrees, and what <hi>Prefaces</hi> there were to it, I have not had particular Information.</p>
                        <p>His Lordſhip having receiv'd Eaſe and Recovery, as is aboveſaid, when firſt it afflicted him, he return'd to the ſame Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy (after the tryal of ſeveral Means at home) and came hither in <hi>July,</hi> 1692. when I had the honour to attend his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and to adviſe in the Uſe of the <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Bath,</hi> and <hi>Pump;</hi> all which his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip uſed in their turns, and but little inward Means beſides the <hi>Waters,</hi> only an <hi>Electuary,</hi> and ſome gentle things, which his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip had been accuſtomed to, to keep his Body ſoluble (for of himſelf he was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry apt to be <hi>Coſtive,</hi> but more upon <hi>Bathing.</hi>)</p>
                        <p>By all which his Lordſhip found great Eaſe, and ſome Strength. But an Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent happening, which call'd his Lordſhip
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:33427:41"/>away before his Cure was perfected, (for he ſtay'd but a Month that time) he had ſtill ſome remaining trouble from that part all the following Winter.

                        <p>As to the occaſion of it he thought it might be this. He delighted much in Hawking, and imputed this Infirmity to his long and often carrying his Hawk upon that Fiſt, in all Weathers, and the frequent <hi>Colds</hi> that he had taken in the Purſuit of that Game.

                        <p>After due Preparation I put him firſt upon <hi>drinking</hi> the <hi>Waters,</hi> becauſe of the <hi>Nephretick Diſtemper;</hi> and withal to correct the Acrimony of this <hi>Defluxion</hi> to his <hi>Arm, Hand</hi> and <hi>Hip, &amp;c.</hi> and then permitted him the <hi>Bath</hi> (to eaſe his Pain, and recover Strength in the weaken'd parts,) but defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Kidneys</hi> with a cooling <hi>Liniment.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>He found not quickly a conſiderable Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration to the better, but went on ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>drinking</hi> the <hi>Waters,</hi> (which after a while, with ſome Aſſiſtances, paſt very well with him) and ſometimes <hi>bathing.</hi> At two Months end, or thereabouts, he went back perfectly recover'd, both as to <hi>Cough, Stomach</hi> and <hi>Sciatica,</hi> and had Eaſe and Strength in, and uſe of his <hi>Arm;</hi> look'd freſh, and better in his Countenance; was fuller and fatter much than when he came hither.

                        <p>Mr. <hi>Cherry,</hi> (a Gentleman of <hi>Maidenhead,</hi> belonging to the Law, aged 40, or more) came hither in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1679. the <hi>Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> before, by a fall from his Horſe, he had his <hi>Left Shoulder</hi> put out of Joynt, and after two Days it was well ſet; but from that time remain'd pain'd and weak, and ſometimes numb'd; ſo that it became not only leſs uſeful, but troubleſome, and uneaſie to him.</p>
                        <p>After Preparation he was put into the <hi>Bath,</hi> and after a Week or ten Days <hi>bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> was put under the <hi>Pump;</hi> all which was continued for about three Weeks or a Month, and he was well recover'd by it, both as to Eaſe and Strength, and Uſe of that <hi>Arm</hi> and <hi>Hand,</hi> and yet ſo continues, I think.</p>
                        <p>He was here in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1691. with a Daughter of his (that came to <hi>drink</hi> theſe <hi>Waters</hi> by Dr. <hi>Brown</hi>'s Directions) and his Son, and his Son's Wife.

                        <p>
                           <hi>Sarah,</hi> the Wife of <hi>Robert Payne,</hi> an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Farmer, of the Pariſh of <hi>Hutton,</hi> near <hi>Banwell,</hi> in <hi>Somerſetſhire,</hi> aged 40, or more; in the year 1675. came to the <hi>Bath</hi> for a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Pain and Weakneſs in her <hi>Right Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Arm</hi> and <hi>Hand,</hi> from a ſharp Defluxion to thoſe parts, from her <hi>Head,</hi> (as is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, having, before that, been often trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with ſevere Fits of the <hi>Head-ach,</hi> and <hi>Rheums</hi> to her <hi>Teeth</hi> and <hi>Jaws.</hi>) There ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd no Swelling, and little or no diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour upon the Parts affected; but for ſome Months before ſhe came hither, they had been exceeding painful, both by Day and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:33427:44"/>Night, but chiefly at Night; and in moiſt and wet Seaſons.</p>
                        <p>She had uſed ſeveral Applications, ſuch as that Country would afford, and what her Neighbours could adviſe, but to little or no purpoſe, which put her upon a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney hither; as ſoon as ſhe came ſhe would go into the <hi>Bath,</hi> and (haſtning to be well, as ſhe at leaſt thought) ſtayd ſometimes longer than ordinary in it, which rather increaſed, than leſſen'd her Pain, (probably, for want of due Preparation, the Humours were heated, dilated, and exaſperated by it.) Under this great Trouble and Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhe came to my Wife (who was her Country woman, born in the ſame Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, and whom ſhe knew (when ſhe kept her Father's Houſe) to make, and give to her Neighbours a white Plaiſter, in caſes of Squats and Bruiſes, and Pains in the <hi>Limbs</hi>) and was importunate with her, to give her one of thoſe <hi>Plaiſters</hi> for her <hi>Arm.</hi> The <hi>Plaiſter</hi> was made of <hi>Burgundy-Pitch, Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incenſe, Bees-wax, &amp;c.</hi> My Wife willing to gratifie her Countrywoman, and to ſave her what Charges ſhe could, gave her a large one, which cover'd <hi>Shoulder, Arm,</hi> and all, to (or below) the <hi>Elbow;</hi> telling her withal, that if ſhe expected Benefit by it, ſhe was not to move it till it ſell off of its ſelf.</p>
                        <pb n="51" facs="tcp:33427:44"/>
                        <p>On ſhe put it, and wore it two or three Days, with ſome Abatement of the violent Pain; about the fourth day ſhe comes to her Doctoreſs, and ſhews her the Sleeve of that <hi>Arm,</hi> as wet, as if it had been dipp'd in the <hi>Bath,</hi> and dropp'd at her Fingers ends. They being both ſtartled at it, I was call'd in to the Conſultation; the <hi>Plaiſter</hi> being mov'd up, there appear'd no broken Skin, no ſheere Bladders, no diſcolour, (there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, probably, no danger of Mortification) but this ſharp <hi>Serum</hi> forced it ſelf through the Pores of the Skin, dilated by the <hi>Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> and attracted from the <hi>Bone,</hi> and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Parts. The Pain decreaſed daily up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, and this Running continued a Week or ten Days; and when it began to ceaſe running, the Matter cruſted upon the part, half an Inch thick, like a <hi>Scabies faeda humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da;</hi> which Cruſt was at length got off, by lomenting it with the <hi>Bath-Water,</hi> and ſome Mollifying Cooling Oyntments, and left no Eroſion of the Skin at all.

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:33427:73"/>of Age, brought to the <hi>Bath</hi> in much the like Caſe. My Lady, her Mother (a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of conſiderable Quality, but I have not leave to mention her Name) being very ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous for her Recovery (it being (if I mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake not her only Daughter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and of which ſhe hath hitherto almoſt deſpair'd; deſired my Advice, and utmoſt Aſſiſtance in the Caſe. It was a <hi>Lameneſs</hi> from a more than ordinary <hi>Weakneſs</hi> in the <hi>Back,</hi> ſo that ſhe could not ſo much as ſit upright in a Chair, much leſs ſtand, or ſuffer to be held upright. The <hi>Lumbal Muſcles,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the <hi>Vertibrae</hi> of the <hi>Loyns,</hi> (tho<hi rend="sup">e</hi> they did not ſtart out) being Relaxed and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feebled. Moreover, when ſhe was forced into an upright Poſture, or put into a Swing (which alſo was ſometimes done whilſt ſhe uſed the <hi>Bath;</hi> for my Lady, her Mother, was greatly apprehenſive of her her growing aſide) ſhe complain'd of a <hi>Pain</hi> and <hi>Streightneſs</hi> all athwart her Belly; the <hi>Muſcles</hi> of the <hi>Abdomen</hi> being probably, contracted, by her ſo long leaning forward, and yielding to the Weakneſs of her <hi>Back;</hi> and when forced out, by a more erect po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, it was painful to her.</p>
                        <p>The beginning of this <hi>Lameneſs</hi> was a violent <hi>Fever,</hi> which after ſome few Days very great Illneſs, ſettled upon the lower
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:33427:73"/>Parts, and remain'd there, with the Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies above-mention'd, many Months after the <hi>Fever</hi> was removed, even to the time that ſhe was brought to this place.</p>
                        <p>After due Preparation, ſhe began with <hi>drinking</hi> theſe <hi>Waters,</hi> and then was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to <hi>bathe,</hi> which ſhe did a Fortnight or more, before any conſiderable Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the better was diſcoverable; but from that time, upon her <hi>drinking</hi> ſome days together, and <hi>bathing</hi> other ſome (in their turns) and Purging between whiles, ſhe, at length, recover'd ſo well, as to be able not only to go alone, and very ſtreight, and upright, but very nimbly alſo, up and down Stairs; without any the leaſt Pain or Diſquiet, or the leaſt appearance of Crookedneſs, which was her Lady-Mother's chiefeſt Fear.</p>
                        <p>She <hi>bathed</hi> in all Thirty times, and <hi>drank</hi> as often, and went from hence well, <hi>Octob.</hi> 7. 1695.</p>

In the beginning of <hi>November</hi> following, I being at Sir <hi>Robert Buttons,</hi> at <hi>Tockenham-Park,</hi> (which is in the ſame Pariſh) I was deſired by my Lady <hi>Button</hi> to ſee this poor Girl, and to give her my Advice, which I did; and by a <hi>Purging Electuary,</hi> (which I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd,

From the <hi>Hip</hi> downwards the <hi>Limb</hi> was greatly waſted, ſo that it was

He was (about ſix Months before he came hither) very Healthful, Luſty and Strong, but go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up a ſteep Hill (when he had been wearied in going before) an intollerable Pain ſeiz'd him on a ſuddain in the Calf of
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:33427:94"/>one of his <hi>Legs,</hi> inſomuch, that (hearing no Gun to go off) he thought that ſome Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy had ſhot him with a Croſs-Bow; but being convinced of the contrary by a Friend of his that came immediately after him, he concluded that he had broken ſomething, by overſtraining: He fell preſently to the Ground, not being able to go a ſtep far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Acuteneſs of the Pain made him ſweat and faint, and very ſick at Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach; but that went off in a while, and ſomething more at Eaſe he was, but not able to go. He was carry'd home, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued weak and lame for a long time, tho' he had the aſſiſtance of the moſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Phyſitians and Chyrurgeons in <hi>England,</hi> many Applications were made outwardly; much Means was uſed inwardly; but with very little Succeſs, which put him upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Bath,</hi> where he apply'd himſelf to me.

<pb n="152" facs="tcp:33427:95"/>of before; it took off the Convulſive Motions which were before frequent, and violent, (eſpecially by Night, and when he was firſt falling aſleep).</p>

                        <p>It was my Wife's Father, Mr. <hi>David Tryme,</hi> of <hi>Wooky,</hi> in the County of <hi>Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet,</hi> near <hi>Wells.</hi> He had, from between Fifty and Sixty, been ſubject to <hi>Fits of the Gout,</hi> but at great diſtances; ſometimes a Year or two, or three, between the Fits; tho' he hunted, and now and then drank chearfully with his Friends (as the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of that Country did then, and ſtill do) and rode in all Weathers. When he had a Fit, his main Care was to get Eaſe as ſoon as he could, and in order to that, he had (or rather his excellent Wife, (who was more than half a Phyſitian, and Chyrurgeon, to her poor Neighbours) procured divers Receipts for <hi>Plaiſters</hi> and <hi>Oyntments;</hi> with a <hi>Probatum eſt</hi> at the end of them. Theſe he ordinarily uſed when the Pains were violent, and if one anſwer'd not, went on to another. This did well enough when Strength and Vigor laſted, but at the Age, I but now mention'd, 83. When that good Wife of his had been long dead, and his, no worſe, Daughter (who ſupply'd her place in thoſe Charitable Offices, as well as keeping her Father's Houſe) was marry'd to me, that lived at ſixteen Miles diſtance; and a ſevere <hi>Fit of the Gout</hi> ſeiz'd him; firſt, at his <hi>Toes</hi> and <hi>Fingers,</hi> and he (impatient under the Pain) cauſing thoſe
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:33427:102"/>that were about him to apply what gave him moſt Eaſe in the laſt Fit; not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering whither it was repercuſſing or no; this mov'd the Diſtemper ſtill upward, and they follow'd it with the ſame Applications, till he fell into Fainting Fits; out of which he was, with Difficulty (and but for a while) got out, with ſtrong Waters. Then, and not till then, was I and his Daughter, my Wife, ſent for.</p>
                        <p>I quickly perceived what Error had been committed, and gave him brisk Cordials, that mov'd, <hi>à centro ad eircumferentiam,</hi> from the <hi>Heart</hi> to the <hi>Limbs:</hi> This threw out the <hi>Gout</hi> ſo violently upon his <hi>Hips, Knees</hi> and <hi>Feet,</hi> that he was, for ſome days, in moſt exceſſive Torment, but free from Faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. He choſe rather (as old as he was) to bear that, then to run the riſque of Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by applying again his Plaiſters. In a little time <hi>Patience</hi> and <hi>Poſſet-drink</hi> conquer'd the Difficulty, for the Pain ceaſed by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, but left ſo great a Weakneſs that he could neither go nor ſtand, and ſuch a Stiff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at <hi>Hips, Knees,</hi> and <hi>Ancles,</hi> that he could not move a Joynt, to extend his <hi>Legs,</hi> but was lifted up and down by main Strength by his Servants. This was in <hi>July,</hi> 1659. and he held thus all the following <hi>Winter,</hi> about the latter of which, calling to ſee him,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:33427:103"/>(as I uſed to do, riding that way to ſome Country Patients, to whom I was ſent for) enquiring of him how he did, He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd me that he was free from Pain, and as well as he could hope to be; <hi>I eat well, and ſleep well, but I am a Cripple; what ſhall I do for that?</hi> I told him that I knew no Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for him unleſs he would come to the <hi>Bath;</hi> which it ſeems he had formerly been frighted from, for fear of bringing a Fit of the <hi>Gout</hi> upon him. I told him that if he would uſe ſuch Preparations as I would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe, and come at the Seaſon that I ſhould appoint, and uſe the <hi>Bath</hi> as I did direct, I would undertake it ſhould not bring the <hi>Gout</hi> upon him. He conſented to it; I ſent to him in <hi>April</hi> following; he came; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Preparation, uſed the <hi>Queen's</hi> and <hi>King's Bath;</hi> but lifted in and out by two ſtrong <hi>Guides;</hi> drank ſome (but not often, nor much) of the <hi>Waters,</hi> (for he thought <hi>Sack</hi> more agreeable to his Age. After three Weeks <hi>bathing,</hi> going one Morning to ſee him in the <hi>Bath,</hi> (which is a uſual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement we pay our Patients here) I found him walking between his two <hi>Guides,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their Help, and wiſhing he could go as well by Land as he did by Water: By and by he bid his <hi>Guides</hi> ſtand off, ſaying, <hi>I cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Story, in ſhort, is this, believe as much of it as you think ſit.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>BLADUD,</hi> eldeſt Son to <hi>Lud-Hudibras,</hi> (then King of <hi>Britain,</hi> and the eighth from <hi>Brute</hi>) having ſpent eleven Years at <hi>Athens</hi> in the Study of the Liberal Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences (that City being in thoſe Days the chief Academy, not only of <hi>Greece,</hi> but of this part of the World alſo) came home a <hi>Leper;</hi> whither from that hotter Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate he had converſed in, or from ill Diet, or Infection, it doth not appear, thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letter'd times giving down little or no Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of things (though of greater moment) then tranſacted; but a <hi>Leper</hi> he was, and for that reaſon ſhut up, that he might not infect others. He, impatient of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, choſe rather a mean Liberty than a Royal Reſtraint, and contrived his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape in a Diſguiſe, and went very remote from his Father's Court, and into an untra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:33427:105"/>part of the Country, and offers his Service in any common Imployment; think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it (probably) likelier to be undiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd under ſuch mean Circumſtances than greater. He was entertain'd in Service at <hi>Swainſwicke</hi> (a ſmall Village, two Miles from this City) his Buſineſs (amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things) was to take Care of the Pigs, which he was to drive from place to place, for their Advantage in Feeding upon Beach-Maſts, Acorns, and Haws, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Hills hereabouts then abounding with ſuch Trees, tho' now few, of the two firſt, remain. Yet there is a Hill, cloſe upon the <hi>South</hi> Part of this City, that ſtill retains the name of <hi>Beachen Cliff,</hi> tho' there is ſcarcely a Beach-Tree left upon it.</p>
                     <p>He thus driving his Swine from place to place, obſerv'd ſome of the Herd, in very cold Weather, to go down from the Side of the Hill into an <hi>Alder-moore,</hi> and thence to return, cover'd with black Mud. Being a Thinking Perſon, he was very ſollicitous to find out the reaſon why the Pigs that wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in the Mire in the Summer, to cool themſelves, ſhould do the ſame in Winter; obſerv'd them farther; and following them down, he at length perceiv'd a Steam and Smoak to ariſe from the place where the Swine wallow'd. He makes a way to it,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:33427:106"/>found it to be warm; and this ſatisfied him, that for the Benefit of this Heat the Pigs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted thither.</p>
                     <p>He being a <hi>Virtuoſo,</hi> made farther Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation; that whereas thoſe filthy Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, by their foul Feeding, and naſty Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, are ſubject to Scabs, and foul Scurſs, and Eruptions on their Skin, ſome of his Herd that were ſo, after a while, became whole and ſmooth, by their often wallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this Mud.</p>
                     <p>Upon this he conſiders with himſelf, why he ſhould not receive the ſame Benefit by the ſame Means; he trys it, and ſucceeded in it; and when he found himſelf cured of his <hi>Leproſie,</hi> declares who he was; his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter was not apt to believe him, at firſt, but at length did, and went with him to Court, where he (after a while) was owned to be the King's Son, and after his Father's Death ſucceeded him in the Government, and built this City, and made theſe <hi>Baths.</hi> An old Manuſcript Chronicle that I have by me, (tho' it hath much larger Stories of other Kings before, and after, him, even from <hi>Brute</hi> himſelf) hath this only of King <hi>BLADUD.</hi>

The Modeſty of their <hi>Sex,</hi> and the Reſpect we owe them for it, challenge an Exemption from publiſhing their Names, at leaſt in ſome of their Infirmities. And ſince God and Nature hath given them the heavier end of the Staff, in bearing the Burthens of this Life, we ought (in good Manners, as well as in Juſtice) to make it as eaſie to them as we can. Where it will well conſiſt with Decency, I ſhall adventure to name ſome, but in ſome other Caſes I ſhall deſire to be excuſed; for I do not forget I had a Mother, a Wife, and two Daughters, to whom I owed, and (I hope) paid, Duty, Reſpect, and Love, and can hardly forbear to perform it to their Memories: I would therefore publiſh nothing, concerning that
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:33427:113"/>Sex, that I did think they would diſlike, if they, or any of them, had lived to read it. And farther, as old as I am, I would not, in the leaſt, offend any of that <hi>Fair part of the Creation,</hi> but would die, as well as live, in their good Opinion.</p>

                        <p>A little Son of Coll. <hi>Farwells,</hi> of the <hi>Tower,</hi> about Five or Six Years of Age, was ſent to the <hi>Bath,</hi> and recommended to my Care by Dr. <hi>Gideon Harvey,</hi> (Phyſitian to the <hi>Tower</hi>) in <hi>May,</hi> 91. Being ſent for to him, by the Nurſe that came with him, when he firſt came to Town, he was ſitting upon a Table, when I came in, and appear'd to me ſo well, as if nothing ail'd him; he look'd ſo plump and freſh, and very well colour'd; but when the Nurſe ſet him down, there appear'd not only a Weakneſs at the Small of his <hi>Back,</hi> but Contraction of all his <hi>Lower Limbs,</hi> from the <hi>Hips</hi> downward<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> inſomuch, that they were ſo far from ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting him, that he could not, of himſelf extend a Leg, nor ſuffer it to be extended to
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:33427:136"/>its due length, by another. He would crawl up and down upon a Table, or the Floor; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing active enough, and willing to play; but, not having a ready Uſe of his Lower Parts, could not, but was Scramm'd, drawn up al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together. He <hi>eat</hi> and <hi>drank,</hi> and ſlept pretty well, and ſeem'd to be recover'd of all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Illneſſes, and other Remainders of the <hi>Rickets,</hi> except this of his Lower Parts.</p>
                        <p>After a whiles reſt, and ſome Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we put him into the <hi>Bath,</hi> at firſt twice a Week, afterwards every other day; at length four days in the Week, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times every day, except <hi>Sundays;</hi> (when the <hi>Baths</hi> are ſhut up) and all this was done without any great Diſturbance to him. In the firſt Month or ſix Weeks there was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little ſenſible Alteration to the better; at length we obſerv'd that he could erect him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a little (and truly but a little) more than at firſt, and ſuffer'd his <hi>Legs</hi> to be drawn out, in the <hi>Bath</hi> (which we made the <hi>Guides</hi> do) with leſs Complaint than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly. After Ten Weeks Stay he return'd, and got Advantage by degrees, inſomuch, that when he came hither the ſecond time (which was with my Lord <hi>Lucas,</hi> in <hi>August,</hi> 93. he was able to run about, and to play at Trap, and Top and Scourge, with the Boys.

                     <p>But as to the Antiquity of their inward uſe, this I know (and did at my firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to live here) by the Information of the ancienteſt People that were upon the Place; and that were Born and Bred here, (and there were two, a Man and his Wife, one or both of them, <hi>Bath Guides</hi> to the King's-<hi>Bath</hi> (<hi>Newmans</hi> by Name) that made Nineſcore between them; for what one wanted of Fourſcore and Ten, the other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded.)</p>

Whither by his living in <hi>Africa,</hi> (a hot Country) or ſome other Accidents, he had ſeveral Indiſpoſitions upon him, amongſt others, this of the <hi>Palpitation of the Heart</hi> in a very great meaſure, ſo that it became very trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome to him, and he apply'd himſelf to ſeveral Phyſitians for the Removal of it;
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:33427:167"/>and was at length adviſed (or enclin'd of himſelf) to <hi>drink</hi> theſe <hi>Waters.</hi> He came hither in <hi>Summer,</hi> 78. and deſir'd my Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, in directing him how to manage himſelf in the Uſe of them.</p>
                        <p>After due Preparation (by <hi>Bleeding, Purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c.</hi>) he began upon them, and <hi>drank</hi> them about Ten Days, and would then needs try how the <hi>Bath</hi> would agree with him, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſome uneaſineſs in his <hi>Limbs,</hi> (at leaſt as he pretended, being willing to try all things.) <hi>Bathe</hi> he did, tho' I foretold him, it would rather increaſe than diminiſh that Symptom for which, chiefly, he came hither. He found it too true; gave it quickly over; and return'd to his <hi>Water-drinking;</hi> which in a Month, or Five Weeks time, remov'd the <hi>Palpitation;</hi> got him a better Habit of Body, which was continued for ſome conſiderable time: But at laſt he was ſeiz'd by a <hi>Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane Ague,</hi> which ſtuck long upon him, and at length left many ill, <hi>Scorbutical Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms</hi> behind it, for ſome of which he made an <hi>Iſſue</hi> in his <hi>Left Arm,</hi> to which a very great Quantity of Sharp and Virulent Matter tended, much more than could be diſcharged at that ſmall Orifice; and therefore brake out all round about it; for which alſo he came again to this place, but to little or no purpoſe; it became at length <hi>Chyrurgeon</hi>'s

                        <p>The next and laſt inſtance upon this Head, is an ill Habit of Body, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Weakneſs, joyned with an intermitting Feaver (a <hi>Tertian</hi>) a ſhort Cough; an ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated Body and languid Spirits, and all this after a <hi>Rheumatiſm,</hi> in which the Pains were ſo great, all her <hi>Lymbs</hi> ſo weak, and her Strength ſo decay'd, that ſhe was forced for a long time, to be lifted from place to place, and even then ready to faint under their Hands. It was Mrs. <hi>Lydia Merefeild,</hi> Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow to Captain <hi>Robert Merefeild</hi> of <hi>Crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hern,</hi> in the County of <hi>Somerſet.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This illneſs was contracted by Riding many Hours thorough-wet, and after it was Night; it continued upon her ſome Months, with ſuch violence, that her Life was often deſpaired of. When the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Pains, and the Feaver were in ſome meaſure abated, ſhe was left in the
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:33427:190"/>Condition above-mentioned, and had withal, a pale and yellow Countenance, ſwell'd <hi>Leggs,</hi> and every other Day, a minding of a Feaver and Ague; it began with a little Chill, but was moſtly hot and dry. In theſe Circumſtances ſhe was brought to <hi>Bath</hi> the laſt day of <hi>April</hi> 94. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome Preparatory means, ſhe was firſt put upon drinking of the <hi>Waters,</hi> which did not preſently agree with her, and when they did, it did not quickly appear that ſhe was better. For the firſt three Weeks or a Month (in which time ſhe bathed but little) ſhe got little Ground, after that it daily appeared that ſhe had not loſt her labour. Her Countenance cleared, her Appetite renewed, her Digeſtion mended, and the ſwelling of her Legs vaniſhed, and ſhe could not eaſily recollect when ask'd, which was her ill day? Then was ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted more frequent Bathings, and longer ſtay, and ſhe bore it better then at firſt, by which the remaining Pains of her <hi>Lymbs</hi> cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and Strength increaſed, ſo that ſhe could go up and down Stairs (which ſhe could hardly do before, by reaſon of a great weakneſs in her Knees and Ancles) ſhe could walk the Town, and the Meadows, and at length (about the middle of <hi>June</hi>) returned Home, and hath continued in a
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:33427:191"/>good ſtate of Health ever ſince, and is now the ſame chearful Widdow as before.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <hi>Yarburgh,</hi> a Gentleman of Fifty Six Years of Age (I think out of <hi>Lincoln-ſhire,</hi>) having for many years paſt been ſubject to difficulty in Swallowing (eſpecially liquids) came to the <hi>Bath,</hi> and ſent for me <hi>July</hi> 14. 1680. He had conſulted ſeveral Phyſitians
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:33427:191"/>before, particularly Dr. <hi>Willis,</hi> who judged his Caſe (as he told me) a <hi>Paralyſis</hi> of the <hi>Muſsles</hi> of the <hi>Oiſophagus;</hi> others ſuppoſed it a Tumour upon the upper Mouth of the <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach;</hi> but upon tryal there appeared no hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs nor extraordinary Diſtention or Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, upon that Region. But ſome not ſatisfied with either of the former cauſes, aſcribed it to a Cold and <hi>Phlegmatick Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper</hi> of the <hi>Stomach,</hi> and a Scorbutick Matter, ſticking to the folds of that part, cauſing a Convulſive Motion of its own <hi>Fibres,</hi> which drew into conſent thoſe of the <hi>Oiſophagus</hi> alſo. What ever was the cauſe, the effect was, a conſtant diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, ſometimes inability to ſwallow.</p>
                        <p>Having tryed (as he thought at leaſt) all other means, he at length came hither, to experiment theſe <hi>Waters,</hi> which I ſoon put him upon the drinking of, cauſing him to take at firſt, ſome <hi>Stomack Pills</hi> over Night, and the <hi>Waters</hi> next Morning, theſe <hi>Pills</hi> were continued two or three Nights follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, after which he took the <hi>Waters</hi> alone, perhaps ſometimes ſome Drops of <hi>Sal Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile Oleoſum</hi> in them. It was no ſmall difficulty for him at firſt to ſwallow a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity enough to make them paſs, but by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, that obſticle was removed, ſo that they at length did very well with him. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:33427:192"/>the Concluſion, we put him into the <hi>Bath,</hi> only to have his Stomach and Neck pumped upon; but with a Defenſative to his <hi>Kidneys</hi> for he was ſubject to the Stone.</p>
                        <p>He went away very much advantaged, and I never heard to the contrary, but that he continued ſo.</p>

She had often returns of this Bleeding, which would quickly be ſtopped by this Application, and putting her Hands into cold Water.</p>

                        <p>But in <hi>March</hi> 93, falling a Bleeding in the Night, and thoſe accuſtomed Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies failing her, ſhe was let Blood to a great quantity, upon which loſs of Blood, both by the Diſeaſe and Remedy, her Swallow was wholly ſtopped (and ſhe thought that to be the cauſe) which laſted for ſome time.</p>
                        <p>She could chew her Meat, and with her Tongue, thruſt it back to the top of the Gullet, but down it would not go, till thruſt down with her Finger, which ſhe told me ſhe have been often forced to do, to prevent Starving. She came hither in <hi>May</hi> 94, and conſulted me, being recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to me by my very good Friend Dr. <hi>Perrin</hi> of that Country. When ſhe firſt came, ſhe could hardly ſwallow the <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> by Spoonfuls, but afterwards could drink half a pint at a Draught, and three Pints or more in a Morning. After a Months Drinking, I adviſed pumping of her Neck and Throat, which could not be done without going into the <hi>Bath,</hi> which I apprehended a hazard from, leaſt it ſhould put her again upon Bleeding at the Noſe. But it was ſo ordered, that by ſtaying there no longer then to be Pumped, and then coming immediately out, ſhe eſcaped that hazard, and after ſix or ſeven Weeks ſtay,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:33427:193"/>went home ſo well (and continued to muſt part of the following Winter) that ſhe came again in Summer 95, and Drank and Pumped as the Year before, and had no ſmall Addition to her former Benefit.</p>

According to his Directions, he began the drinking of them, and went on ſome time with them; but inſtead of eaſing his Pain, they increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it, and with the Pain he ſeemed to be inwardly convulſed, ſo that after a Week or Ten Days Tryal, he was forced to give them over.

Drink he would like, ſometimes too well. Withthis ill Dyet, and loſs of Appetite, he had a tendency to a <hi>Cachexie,</hi> looked yellow in the Face, Vomited Mornings, was Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and Fainty, and ſubject to a <hi>Diarrhaea.</hi> He complained always (more or leſs) of a Pain in his Left Side. For beſides that, he had been greatly <hi>Splenetick,</hi> he had been run through on that Side in a Duel. His Spirits being low, and he ſo faint, and (as is ſaid) apt to reach and ſtrain to Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, (though little or nothing came up) eſpecially in a Morning, when he met with any Company (which by the way, he was not very apt to avoid) he choſe Sack for his Liquor, rather then any other Wine, which heated and inflam'd him, and (in ſhort) all theſe things together, had ſpoiled a good Habit of Body, and left him (in his own, and every Body's O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion) in a declining Condition.</p>

<pb n="362" facs="tcp:33427:201"/>His chief Complaints were, decay of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and Strength, (chiefly in his Back.) The Remedies he had taken, he thought took off his Stomach, for he could digeſt nothing, all things that he eat, came up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; he was withal in great Pain, ſo that he could not ſleep at Night, nor was he at eaſe by Day, in any poſture, whether Sitting, Walking, Standing or Lying. At length the <hi>Jaundice</hi> appeared by the yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowneſs of his Skin, and the Whites of his Eyes. Under theſe weak Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des he came hither, as is above ſaid, and was ſo faint and tyrie, and enfeebled, that he contented himſelf with a ſmall Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, not being able to go up another pair of Stairs, to a larger and better Room.</p>
                        <p>He applyed himſelf to me for Advice, and (after ſome Preparation, what he need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and could well bear) I put him upon drinking theſe <hi>Waters, Bathing</hi> not being at all likely to agree with him, nor did he, as I remember, once bath at all. It was more then a Week, or Ten Days, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could diſcover the leaſt Alteration to the better, but at length, the Water paſſing well, opened his Body (which was apt to be coſtive before) cleared the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, reſtored his Stomach, and abated his Pains, by which he was enabled to Sleep,
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:33427:201"/>Eat, and Digeſt, (and conſequently to get Strength, which he did in every part, but his Back, where ſome Weakneſs, more or leſs, hath ſtill continued.) He came a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time the ſame Year, about <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and was then ſo much amended, that he that could he hardly heard to ſpeak in a wide Chamber, (his Lungs and Voice were ſo weak when he came firſt) before he went away, preacht in our large Church, with great applauſe.</p>

They gave him uſually two or three Stools, but paſt moſtly by Urine, and did not bring off a great deal of <hi>Gravil</hi> neither, but mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly abated the Acrimony of the Humour, and conſequently leſſened the ſharpneſs of his <hi>Urine,</hi> ſo that he could retain his Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a longer time, and make larger quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities, and take reſt between whiles.</p>
                        <p>After a Month or five Weeks drinking thus, theſe <hi>VVaters,</hi> and gently Purging between whiles, and at Concluſion, he went off greatly relieved, and continued ſo for a conſiderable time, and lived (for ought I ever heard) free from this Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome.

                        <p>After Preparation, he drank alſo of the Waters, which quickly agreed with him, and paſt ſo well both by Stool and Urine, that there was little need of giving much Phyſick with them; a <hi>Balſamick Pill,</hi> he took frequently of over-night, and drank the <hi>Waters</hi> next Morning.

I ſhall next give ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the uſefulneſs of theſe Waters, when <hi>Gravil</hi> and <hi>Stones</hi> are already Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creted.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall begin with a worthy <hi>Corniſh</hi> Knight, a Gentleman of a true Old <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Temper, Sir <hi>John Cotton</hi> of <hi>Botrux-Caſtle,</hi> in <hi>Cornwell,</hi> who having had for many years paſt, ſeveral ſevere Fits, and in them voided much Gravil, and Stones of a conſiderable bigneſs and craggedneſs, which always occaſion'd Bloody Water, by lacerating the Veſſels as they paſſed, and previous to each Fit, he uſually made a dark and turbid Urine, like Blood and Dirt mix'd together. After ſeveral at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts for Eaſe and Cure, he at length
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:33427:204"/>came to drink theſe Waters in <hi>July</hi> 94, and was recommended to my Care by Dr. <hi>Waldrond</hi> of <hi>Exeter,</hi> whoſe Patient he had been ſome time before. Being prepared by taking a Purging <hi>Nephretick Bolus,</hi> he began with three Pints of the Water, which at length he increaſed by Degrees, to Five, and after that to three Quarts. Never did Waters agree ſooner, paſs ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier, and better with any one, then they did with him, and continued ſo to do, and brought off daily great quantities of <hi>Sabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum,</hi> and ſome ſmall <hi>Stones,</hi> rough and <hi>Scabrous,</hi> and bigger then <hi>Barly-Corns,</hi> but fryable, and might be broken into ſmall <hi>Gravil</hi> betwixt ones Finger and Thumb, and all this without Pain, the Paſſages were ſo much dilated. He continued thus to do, (taking once a Week, or therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts, his <hi>Nephritick Bolus</hi>) for a Month, riding out every Day (except in ill Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) after his Waters, which he thought promoted their paſſing, and the coming off of the <hi>Gravil,</hi> and without doubt it did.</p>
                        <p>The Waters got and continued him a very good Stomach, he had not in the leaſt any thing like a Fit, all the while he ſtay'd here, and that was more then a Month. Going hence in his Coach (which perhaps ſhook his Kidneys more then riding
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:33427:204"/>on Horſe-back) by that time he came to <hi>Exeter</hi> (where he deſigned to ſtay a while with ſome Friends) he began to make a turbid and diſcoloured Urine, which was accompanied with ſome ſharpneſs and Blood, upon which followed a violent Fit of the <hi>Stone,</hi> which after much Pain, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the bringing off of a larger Stone then ever he had voided before (as he writ me word from thence) it was an Inch and half in Circumference in the biggeſt part, and long like a <hi>Date-ſtone.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is obvious to think that a Stone of that bigneſs could not have paſſed thoſe narrow parts as are the <hi>Uritors, Urethra,</hi> &amp;c. had they not been very much dilated, and ſubrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the drinking of theſe Waters ſo lately before, and probably had he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued here till this Stone had moved out of the <hi>Kidneys,</hi> it might have come off eaſier then it did. He held ſo well all the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Winter, that he was encouraged to come again the next Summer, and drank theſe Waters a Week longer then he did before, ſcarcely intermitting a Day, and had no Fit here, but ſtill avoided the ſame Sabulous Matter, when firſt he drank them; but towards the Concluſion, the quantity of <hi>Gravil</hi> abated.</p>

Amongſt them they pickt out the concreted Chalk by little and little, and afterwards healed up the parts, and this rendred the Joynts more plyable, ſo that he could ſet his Feet to the Ground, bend and put ſtreight his Knees, ſupport his Body, handle Crutches, and at length went with a Staff only, and continued thus for ſome conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable time. Whilſt theſe things were doing to his Joynts, he continued to drink the <hi>Waters,</hi> and took <hi>Arthritick Pills,</hi> had Cordials to ſupport him in his Faintineſs, and uſed gentle means (when needed) to keep him ſoluble. This Encouragement brought him again to the <hi>Bath,</hi> a Year or two af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when he improved what he <hi>at</hi> firſt got.

                        <p>Mr. <hi>Edward Buſhel,</hi> Senior, (one of the Aldermen of this City) now aged 70 Years and a half. About <hi>Michaelmaſs,</hi> in the 67th.

<pb n="375" facs="tcp:33427:207"/>that with Pain, ſo violent, that it put him all over into a Sweat.

                        <p>At the end of the Eleven Months, he made Bloody Water, and his Pains in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, all concluding this to be a large, as well as a ſharp and cragged Stone in the Right Kidney, he was perſwaded to give off Riding, which till then, he daily did, not only in his Buſineſs about his Grounds, but in hopes by it to get ſome Eaſe, and help down what c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Upon ſight of the Bloody Urine, he took to the drinking of theſe Waters, and hath ſcarcely omitted them ſince, no Weather or ſeaſon of the Year hinders him, but Froſt or Snow, Cold or Hot, Rain or Shine, he goes on with them, and with like Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, in all Weathers, ſometimes with, ſometimes without Syrup of <hi>Marſh-mallows.</hi> For they ſoon eaſed his Pain, made him piſs free and clear.

Nor are theſe returns now ſo violent as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, nor hath he pain where it began, (on the right Kidney) but juſt at making Water, on the top of his Yard.

                        <p>I ſhall conclude this Eighth (and laſt) Chapter, with what I promiſed in the beginning of it, which is an aſſurance (and I hope you will take my word for it) that not a few have been here Cured, by the regular drinking of theſe Waters (and (no very chargeable, (nor troubleſome) Remedies taken with them) of long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, inveterate, and virulent <hi>Gonorrhaeas,</hi> and of thoſe Weakneſſes they uſually leave behind them, for the <hi>Bath-Waters</hi> both Cleanſe and Heal, and ſtrengthen the parts concerned, and (as in all other Acidities, Acrimony, and ſharpneſs of the Blood and Nervous juice) they cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect that Corroſiveneſs, and dilute that Acrimony, and conſequently, alter the temper of that Matter that is there diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and by its Balſamick Virtue, heals the parts that may have been excoriated, or eroded by it.</p>

                     <head>THE Concluſion.</head>
                     <p>AND now that I have given ſome few Inſtances, out of very many that might have been produced, had it not been for fear of making this <hi>Manual</hi> of too great a Bulk; (yet I hope theſe are enough to ſhew how effectual the uſe of the <hi>Bath,</hi> and the drinking theſe <hi>Waters,</hi> have been in the ſeveral Caſes there enumerated) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all this (I ſay) It ſeems to me as
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:33427:211"/>needful to add ſomething by way of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, as it was to prefix a Preface.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. And in doing this, I ſhall again aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert the Veracity of each Obſervation, in the main Concerns of each Caſe; though in ſome little (and thoſe not conſiderable) Circumſtances, there may poſſibly be ſome ſmall Alterations. If there appears to be any miſtake in the time of any ones coming hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or ſtay here, I hope that will eaſily be excuſed, when it is conſidered, how many (in my time) I have been concerned with.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. And then Secondly, (though poſſibly it may not be in every one particularly mentioned) I have with moſt (if not all) of the Patients, that have been by Letter, recommended to my Care, by other Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, written back to them (at their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn at leaſt, if not whilſt they have been proſecuting their Courſe, which often I have done) what they did whilſt they were here; what did, or did not ſucceed, according to Expectation, what interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions there had been, and how each Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon went from hence, and what I thought fit farther to be done for them, but ſo as leaving it to their farther Conſideration, and to be added to, or alter'd, as they ſaw cauſe, which thing I always though at due
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:33427:211"/>Civility, to all of our Faculty, and a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction at leaſt, if not a Service, to the Patient. And to thoſe that came with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch Recommendation (eſpecially out of the Country, and where no Phyſician was near them, or had been before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned with them) I have ſent home with them ſome familiar Directions, to uſe ſuch things as they could themſelves prepare, or eaſily procure, but no ſuch Baskets of Phyſick, as have been brought down hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (as if none had been to be had here, nor Advice neither,) though in thus do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I have not perhaps been thanked by the <hi>Apothecaries</hi> that live here.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. For (in the third place) I can ſafely ſay, I have not burthened a Patient with unneceſſary Medicines, moſt that come hither, being already tired with long and tedious courſes of Phyſick, even to the loathing of almoſt every thing that comes out of an <hi>Apothycary</hi>'s Shop. Nor indeed, without this Conſideration, that I could the better experiment the Efficacy of the <hi>Waters,</hi> for when Medicines are continually thrown in with Bathing, or drinking the <hi>Waters,</hi> it can hardly be deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to which of the two, the Succeſs is to be aſcribed.</p>
                     <pb n="384" facs="tcp:33427:212"/>
                     <p>Though (where neceſſity required it) I have not been wanting earneſtly to preſs what due Preparation, and needful Alte<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ration, and ſupport with Cordials, ſeemed to me to require. If I have erred on either Hand, I muſt needs acknowledge, that in (perhaps too much) pitty to the Patients, it hath been rather, in urging too little, then wearying them with too much.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. The fourth thing I would advertiſe is (which in ſome of the Caſes hath been already intimated, if not expreſt) that it is not a trick of the Place, (as ſome have called it) or a bare Conſolation to a deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponding Perſon (that hath not found a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Recovery, whilſt here upon the place) to keep up his Spirits for the preſent, till he is got out of Town (as hath been ſaid by others) to tell him at going off, that he will find the Benefit of it afterwards, For ſeveral of the Fore-mentioned inſtances prove the truth of it; and I have a Signal one to add, but that I have forgotten the Gentlewomans Name, and can by no means retreive it.</p>
                     <div type="observation">
                        <head>OBSERV.</head>
                        <p>She (for an univerſal Weakneſs from Head to Foot, not able to ſtir any part,
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:33427:212"/>but Heart whole, as they call it, and of ſound Mind and Memory) was brought hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a Litter out of <hi>Hampſhire,</hi> (or the <hi>Iſle</hi> of Weight,) and ſtay'd ſix Weeks or two Months, without any ſenſible Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the better, inſomuch, that ſhe deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired of ever being recovered, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ordered her return home, reſolving to try nothing further, this being her laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, and ſhe being ſufficiently tyred with Medicines before. As ſoon as ſhe came home, made her Will, took leave of all her Friends, and not only expected, but wiſh'd to dye, being a Burthen to her ſelf. At ſix or ſeven Weeks end, inſtead of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining more and more, ſhe found ſome ſmall beginnings of Senſe and Motion, in her extream parts, which day by day in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, till ſhe was perfectly recovered. As in the caſe of <hi>Philiip Brown,</hi> Book I. Chap. VI. Obſerv. X. and in the Caſe of Sir <hi>John Clobery,</hi> Book I. Chap. II. Obſerv. III. Many more ſuch inſtance, without doubt, might have been had, if the Spirit of Ingratitude, and Careleſneſs, had not poſſeſſed a great many of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In our Saviours time, of the Ten <hi>Leapers</hi> that were cleanſed, there returned but one that acknowledged it and he a <hi>Samaritane</hi> too) if but One in Ten of thoſe
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:33427:213"/>
                           <hi>Jews,</hi> that have received an after-recovery here, and never acknowledged it, had but given a Line or two (which was all the fartheſt thanks I ever expected, nay I would have thanked them for it) to let me know the Succeſs, this Concluſion, (for ought I know) might have been as big as the whole Book.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. A fifth particular that I would have obſerved is, that thoſe that came timely before their Spirits were ſpent, or their entrals corrupted or decayed, and their Fleſh quite waſted (yea ſome of thoſe too) have been here much relieved, if not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly recovered. Nay ſome of thoſe, that moſt People that ſaw them, have judged they were ſent hither purpoſely to dye here, we have made a ſhift, (and ſometimes a hard one too) to ſend back again, that their own Bell might ring our for them, and not ours.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. Another, and a ſixth Duty which I think my ſelf oblig'd to do, is to give ſome neceſſary cautions to thoſe that come hither for Cure, and thoſe will concern mainly theſe two Things; the time of their coming, the choice of their Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, Lodging and <hi>Bath,</hi> they are to uſe.</p>
                        <pb n="387" facs="tcp:33427:213"/>
                        <p>Firſt, as for the time, that which is freeſt from either exceſs of Heat or Gold, is certainly the fitteſt (generally ſpeaking) for all Perſons and Diſtempers. Since my Remembrance, there was as known, a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction at <hi>Bath,</hi> betwixt <hi>Spring</hi> and <hi>Fall,</hi> as was in the reſt of the Nation, betwixt Summer and Winter, Company uſually coming hither in <hi>April</hi> or <hi>May,</hi> (ſome for <hi>Aches</hi> and <hi>Lameneſs</hi> in <hi>March</hi>) and going off again at the end of <hi>June,</hi> or beginning of <hi>July,</hi> which was called the <hi>Spring,</hi> and they came again about the middle of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt,</hi> and ſtayed till the end of <hi>September,</hi> and part of <hi>October,</hi> and this was called the <hi>Fall.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>At the return of K. <hi>Charles</hi> II. (when all the World went to <hi>London</hi> to live) this was alter'd by ſome famous Phyſicians there, who could not (or would not ſpare their Patients, till the hot Weather came on, that they could take no more Phyſick, and then they ſent ſome to ſweat at the <hi>Bath,</hi> and others to cool themſelves at <hi>Epſum</hi> and <hi>Tunbridge,</hi> few to the <hi>Bath,</hi> with a good Will, becauſe three days journey from them, more to the <hi>Wells,</hi> becauſe within their kenn.</p>
                        <pb n="388" facs="tcp:33427:214"/>
                        <p>Second, and for the other particulars, as the <hi>Spaniard</hi> ſaid; <hi>Ragio di Stado, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of State</hi> is a very great <hi>Knave,</hi> ſo may every one ſay, that Intereſt, and Self-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dedneſs, is not very honeſt. Every Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtands in the beſt Air, and neareſt the beſt <hi>Bath,</hi> by the report of him that keeps it. The beſt <hi>Phyſician,</hi> is he that hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven advice for nothing, or at leaſt helped him to Lodgers, and if you ask any <hi>Apothecary,</hi> he is certainly (in his Opinion) to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, that preſcribes moſt Phyſick. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it would be prudent to be directed to your <hi>Phyſician</hi> before you come, and not to heed what is ſaid againſt him, or for another, afterward, at leaſt be adviſed by ſome diſ intereſted Perſon, that is upon the Place, and be directed by him, in what Air to Lodge, and what <hi>Bath</hi> to uſe, and what <hi>Apothecary</hi> to employ. And indeed you will need to be very well adviſed, by whom you are recommended to a <hi>Phyſician,</hi> for you may think ſome Perſons are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſted when they are not ſo; for we have had ſome here lately, that have not only magnifyed themſelves above others, and talked great things in <hi>Coffee Houſes,</hi> and ſhew their Drops, as a <hi>Mountebank</hi> doth his <hi>Balſame</hi> upon the Stage) but have alſo urged their Patients and Acquaintance, to

If <hi>Hippocrates</hi> (a Heathen) in his Book <hi>de Docenti ornatu,</hi> thinks it a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Preparation in a young Phyſician, ſetting himſelf upon Practice, to reverence the Gods, and to give up to them. How much more ſhould a Chriſtian (one that
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:33427:216"/>owns (or ſhould do ſo) the only One, and true God) I think it his Duty to begin with Applications to him, that can only make his Endeavours ſucceſsful.</p>
                        <p>Though I know that our Profeſſion (with a great many) lies under the Scandal of Atheiſm, and that by ſome, an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency in Religion, at leaſt, is accounted no ſmall ingredient, to make up an Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Phyſician; and that I was once told by one, that thought himſelf above the National Profeſſion of the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion (for he walked with the <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> as he himſelf termed it) when he reproved one of his own Perſwaſion, for making uſe of one of our Profeſſion, that was not far from a declared <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> he anſwered him, that the leſs he thought of Religion, the more he might think of his Calling. In effect, the leſs a Chriſtian, the more a Phyſician.</p>
                        <p>For all theſe Diſcouragements, I am not aſhamed to own, that I as conſtantly did, and do, pray for my Patients, as for my Self, my Wife and Children (when I had them) or as I do now for my deareſt Grand Child for whom, all that know me, know that I am ſollicitous enough, if not to a Fault.)

To be ſure, they that do not pray here, will hardly be thought fit to praiſe hereafter, when Love and Praiſes will be the Buſineſs of a Happy Eternity; when the High and Holy God will be continually magnifyed by Men and Angels, in all his great and Glorious Attributes, eſpecially in thoſe of his <hi>Wiſdom, Love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mercy</hi> and <hi>Free-Grace,</hi> and Good Will, towards Men through <hi>Jeſus,</hi> when Mockers and Scoffers ſhall be caſt out.
